# Hi there, I'm Aya Hourani ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Data Science & Analytics portfolio!

I hold a *Bachelor's in Computer Engineering* and a *Master's in Software Engineering* from Rutgers University. My academic and professional experiences have allowed me to explore a variety of data-focused projects â€” from building stock portfolio web apps to conducting exploratory data analysis and developing machine learning models.

During my previous internship, I led the implementation of Jira to streamline agile software project tracking, which helped improve team efficiency and transparency.

I'm passionate about working on projects that reflect my personal interests and curiosity â€” you'll find that many of the analyses here are driven by real-world problems and topics I genuinely care about.

This repository showcases my latest work in data science and analytics. Thanks for stopping by!
